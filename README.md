# Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project focuses on detecting emotions from voice recordings in multiple languages using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization for multilingual emotion recognition.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice.ipynb` ‚Äì The main Jupyter notebook containing the full pipeline for emotion detection in voice data.
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview and setup instructions.

## üí° Features

- Supports multiple languages for emotion detection
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs)
- Model training using neural networks
- Performance evaluation with visualizations
- Modular and easy to extend for additional languages or models

## üì¶ Dependencies

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn librosa scikit-learn keras tensorflow
````

You may also need `pyaudio` or `soundfile` depending on how audio input/output is handled.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies listed above.
3. Run the notebook step-by-step to:

   * Load and preprocess audio data
   * Extract audio features (MFCCs)
   * Train and evaluate the model
   * Visualize results

## üß™ Example Usage

Run the notebook to see how a trained model can predict emotions from voice clips across different languages. The model outputs common emotional states such as:

* Happy
* Sad
* Angry
* Neutral
* Fear
* Surprise
* Disgust

## üìä Results

The notebook includes visualizations such as:

* Confusion matrix
* Accuracy/loss curves
* Spectrograms and waveforms
